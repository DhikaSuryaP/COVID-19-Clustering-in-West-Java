# COVID-19-Clustering-in-West-Java
The purpose of this research is to classify time-series data on the number of daily COVID-19 cases based on the dynamics that occur so that it can be identified which cities are effective for imple-menting restrictions on community activities in West Java. We performed time-series clustering on daily positive case data for COVID-19 in 27 cities and regencies in West Java Province, Indonesia for this study. The K-medoids Clustering algorithm is used for clustering, with the magnitude of the distance determined by the type of shape-based lock step measures, specifically, the cross correla-tion-based distance.
